course_name: Introduction to Machine Learning
course_description: "This educational endeavor is designed to introduce personnel from various departments and diverse professional backgrounds to the fundamental concepts of machine learning. The curriculum places a strong emphasis on supervised machine learning techniques, particularly as they apply to tabular dataâ€”a focus that aligns closely with the core products developed by our ML team.
<br>
This course serves a dual purpose: firstly, to enhance interdepartmental communication, and secondly, to facilitate more effective discussions regarding project requirements and result interpretation. By establishing a shared foundation in machine learning principles and commonly used metrics, we aim to foster improved collaboration and synergy across different functional units within our organization.
